# 🎵 Album Cover Year Prediction

This project explores the relationship between visual design and time in music culture.  
Using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, we aim to **predict the release decade or year of an album** based solely on its cover art.

## 🚀 Overview
Album art reflects the aesthetics, technology, and visual culture of its era.  
By training a deep learning model on thousands of album covers, this project investigates whether a neural network can infer when an album was released from its artwork alone.

## 🧠 Goals
- Build a CNN that classifies album covers by **decade** (e.g., 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, etc.)
- Experiment with **year-level** predictions for higher granularity
- Analyze what **visual features** the model associates with each era

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python • PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- NumPy • Pandas • Matplotlib  
- OpenCV / PIL for image preprocessing

## 📦 Dataset
The dataset will be constructed from publicly available album cover archives (e.g., Discogs, Spotify API, or Last.fm).  
Future versions may include data-cleaning and augmentation pipelines.

## 📊 Future Work
- Transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Feature visualization and interpretability
- Web-based demo for predictions
